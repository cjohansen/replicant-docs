There's no better way to learn than to study other people's code. Luckily, there
are some Replicant apps with source available. Some were made for demonstration
purposes, and others are real apps with open source code.

If you have code using Replicant, or have written blog posts etc about working
with Replicant, [let me
know](https://github.com/cjohansen/replicant-docs/issues), and I'll add links to
them here -- or better yet, [pull request in the
links](https://github.com/cjohansen/replicant-docs/blob/main/content/in-the-wild.md).
